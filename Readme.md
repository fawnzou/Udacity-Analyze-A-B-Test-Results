# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

## Background

For this project, we run an AB test that compares new-page and old-page conversions for a e-commerce website, to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. 

Steps involved during the analysis were data cleaning, A/B testing,hypothesis testing, standard statistical tests, and multiple regression modelling.

## Statistical Analysis

  *  Sampling distributions and p-value calcualtions.
  *  Z-score tests.
  *  Logistic regression
 

## Findings
The conversion rate for the new page was not greater to that of old page.
The country of the user did not imapct the rate of conversion between the new and old page.
